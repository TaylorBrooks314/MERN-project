# MERN-project
## Introduction
  For this project I created an online planner or calendar. The user can sign up and login. It has a year page that allows user to see thier events of the year. From the year page, the user can click on a month and they will be taken to the month page that allows the user see their events for that month. From the month page the user can click on a day and they will be taken to the day page that allows the user to see their events and its start and end times. From the day page the user can click the 'add event' button to add an event or click on an existing event to see more details about that event. From the single event page the user can edit or delete that event. Every page has a navbar at the top with buttons to logout and to take the user to their profile, year, month, and day pages.
